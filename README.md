# Software Engineer Coding Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to highlight the engineerâ€™s skills. Therefore, feel free to show-off and speak to your solution for how and why you chose to do things the way you choose to do them.

## Assessment:

1. Using Angular 15 or above using VS Code (not Visual Studio) and .NET 7 or above using Visual Studio, create a simple CRUD application for "Customer" (First Name, Last Name, Email, Created Date/Time, Last Updated Date/Time) communicating to service.
2. Allow for Updates from the list of customers while requiring adds via form
3. Ensure the application uses session storage to highlight the last customer selected.
4. Ensure application has at least 20 records.
5. Provide repository link for Dynatron Tech Team to download code for review.
6. Be prepared to speak to your solution on scheduled Tech Call.

Listing every possible factor that could impact an application would both be two exhaustive for this assessment and also provide some answers potentially to things you should implement or at least speak to. Therefore, if there are factors you feel compelled to implement to showcase your talent, feel free. If there are other things you choose not to implement because it would be too time consuming, feel free to speak to it so we are able to understand you do have the knowledge but it would be impractical to implement for this assessment. That decision is left to you on how much and how little to include. Keep in mind, we are evaluating your ability to be an early contributor on the development team and your deliverable should showcase your skills.
